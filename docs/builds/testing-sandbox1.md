## Gear
The optimal gear for a {{ title }} build is gear using Dragon stats, which gives a critical hit chance of 98.95% after buffs. Dragon gear is better for this build due to its synergy with other Precision and Critical Hit Chance traits that help the build perform with high critical hits. Full Dragon gear on this {{ title }} avoids the 24.62% over-critting with Marauder gear and performs with 15.7% more raw damage output. Both gear sets increase Vitality, allowing for an increase to the low HP pool of the Guardian to approximately 18k health.
