## Gear
``` title="Template Code"
[&DQkOHQMuPzrcEQAABhIAACsSAADUEQAAyhEAAAQFAAArEgYS1BEAAAAAAAA=]
```
=== "Optimal Gear"
    This armor and stat selection gives the most optimized selection of gear to maximizing DPS while still meeting a 20k HP threshold.
  
  {% include "heavy_armor_tab.md" %}
  
  {% include "trinkets_tab.md" %}

=== "Gear Alternatives"
    A combination of the following affixes can be used in place of the Optimal Gear selection from the previous tab. These are displayed in order of best DPS/health per stat point.

    |Affix|Description|DPS|
    |:---:|:---:|:---:|
    |<div data-armory-embed="items" data-armory-ids="83394,95380" data-armory-83394-stat="1681">| Full Dragon Armor <br />Full Dragon Trinkets|57464.43|
    |<div data-armory-embed="items" data-armory-ids="83394,95380" data-armory-83394-stat="1681">| Full Marauder Armor <br />Full Marauder Trinkets|57464.43|
    |<div data-armory-embed="items" data-armory-ids="83394,95380" data-armory-83394-stat="1681">| Full Valkyrie Armor <br />Full Berserker Trinkets|57464.43|

    Use the Discretize Gear Optimizer for optimizing your gear selection based on what works best for you while keeping the most optimal damage output.

!!! tip end
**Why do I not use Scholar Runes?**<br />
Runes of the Scholar do not allow for a 20k health benchmark to be made unless a complex mix and match of gear stats is made, which actually is lower in offensive stats than Dragon's gear with Divinity Runes. Additionally, Scholar Runes are conditional on a 90% health benchmark, which is challenging to maintain in WvW.
